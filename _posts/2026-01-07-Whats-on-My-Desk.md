I consider it my lifetime mission to find the optimal desktop setup from both a productivity and aesthetic standpoint. There are two basic requirements: to maximize space utilization (especially vertically) and to minimize visual clutter (no visible cables, please). In other words, I need everything I need to be exactly where i need it to be, and everything else out of the way. It's a project that by definition will never see an end, but after years of trying, failing and repeating, at least it's finally in a state that makes me go, hey, I could really enjoy spending ten hours here a day.

3\. __Dell UltraSharp U2515H__ - secondary monitor (potrait orientation)

4\. __Sadness mug__ - any mug works, but I just cannot resist the gloomy, chubby face

5\. __Das Keyboard 4 Professional__ - the oldest piece of hardware in the current lineup; still going strong in its 9th year

6\. __Logitech G604__ - the perfect balance between style and function (however, the fact that this particular model has been discontinued concerns me)

7\. __Lisen Gooseneck Phone Holder__ - puts the distractions where they belong

8\. __iPhone 14 Pro__ - doubles as a webcam

9\. __ThinkPad X1 Carbon__ - work laptop

10\. __Asus ROG Zephyrus M16__ - peronsal laptop; the lids of both laptops are in permanent closed state

11\. __Fezibo standing desk__ - useful in more ways than one: staying active, reducing back pain, saving space (chair can go under), etc.

12\. __Lego minifigure stand__ - seasonally rotating minifigure; also doubles as an extra monitor arm (to prevent wobbling)

13\. __USB switch__ - a hardware shortcut to reconnect keyboard/mouse to the other computer

<br>

14\. __Light bar controller__ - not an absolute necessity, but looks slick so I don't mind

15\. __Baseus Bass BP1 Pro__ - an astonishingly affordable alternative to AirPods Pro

<br>

16\. __Nintendo Switch 2__ - I swear it's not always there

17\. __USB-C cable w/ magnetic adaptor__ - makes plugging/unplugging a one-handed operation; also doubles as a Switch 2 dock/fast charger

_Magnetically attached USB-C dongle - the best thing that happened to USB-C since USB-C in my opinion_
