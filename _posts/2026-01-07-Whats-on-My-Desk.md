I have been looking for the best desktop setup that works for me. There are two basic requirements: to maximize space utilization (especially vertically) and to minimize visual clutter (cables for example). In other words, I need everything i need to be exactly where i need it to be, and everything else out of the way. It's one of my evergreen projects that probably will never be completed, but at least it's finally in a state that makes me proud.

1\. __BenQ ScreenBar Halo 2 LED Monitor Light Bar__ - main source of light

3\. __Dell UltraSharp U2515H__ - secondary monitor (potrait orientation)

4\. __Sadness mug__ - any mug works, but I cannot resist the gloomy, chubby face

5\. __Das Keyboard 4 Professional__ - the oldest piece of hardware in the current lineup; still going strong in its 9th year

6\. __Logitech G604__ - the perfect balance between style and function (however, the fact that this model has been discontinued concerns me)

7\. __Lisen Gooseneck Phone Holder__ - puts the phone where it needs to be (i.e., out of my reach)

8\. __iPhone 14 Pro__ - doubles as a webcam

9\. __ThinkPad X1 Carbon__ - work laptop

10\. __ASUS ROG Zephyrus M16__ - peronsal laptop

11\. __Fezibo standing desk__ - useful in so many ways: reducing back pain, saving space (chair can go under), etc.

12\. __Lego minifigure stand__ - seasonally rotating minifigure; also doubles as a monitor arm to prevent wobbling

13\. __USB switch__ - a hardware shortcut to reconnect keyboard/mouse to the other PC

<br>

14\. __Light bar controller__ not an absolute necessity, but looks slick so I don't mind

15\. __Baseus Bass BP1 Pro__ - an astonishingly affordable alternative to AirPods Pro

<br>

16\. __Nintendo Switch 2__ - I swear it's not always there

17\. __USB-C cable w/ magnetic adaptor__ - makes plugging/unplugging a one-handed operation; also doubles as Switch 2 dock/fast charger

_The best thing that happened to USB-C since USB-C in my opinion_
